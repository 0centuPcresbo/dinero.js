description: Passing an amount to a new Dinero object.
---

The amount is one of the three pieces of domain data necessary to create a Dinero object. It's expressed in the smallest subdivision of the currency, as an integer.

For example, 50 US dollars equal to 5,000 cents.

```js
import { dinero } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

const d = dinero({ amount: 5000, currency: USD });
```

You should always pass integers. The library throws whenever you try to pass a float or any non-integer value.

Dinero.js comes with a [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) implementation, but the library is generic. This means you can use it with any data type you want: [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt), third-parties like [big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js), etc. To do so, check the advanced guide on [using different amount types](https://www.notion.so/Using-different-amount-types-172523012d1647dfb2f2c70624536853).

## No minor units

When using a currency with no minor units, you should express the amount in major units.

```js
import { dinero } from 'dinero.js';
import { JPY } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

// This represents 5,000 Japanese yens
const d = dinero({ amount: 5000, currency: JPY });
```

When working with such currencies, you need to set the [currency exponent](https://www.notion.so/Currency-f0c9b2bc2ddd45b7b960c11f609fa229) to 0.

## Non-decimal currencies

When using a non-decimal currency (with or without multiple subdivisions), you should express the amount in the smallest subdivision.

```js
import { dinero } from 'dinero.js';

// Ancient Greek drachma
const GRD = {
  code: 'GRD',
  base: 6,
  exponent: 1,
};

// This represents 1 ancient Greek drachma
// or 6 obols
const d1 = dinero({ amount: 6, currency: GRD });

// Pre-decimal Great Britain pound sterling
const GBP = {
  code: 'GBP',
  base: 240,
  exponent: 1,
};

// This represents 50 pre-decimal Great Britain pounds
// or 1,000 shillings, or 12,000 pence
const d2 = dinero({ amount: 12000, currency: GBP });
```

When working with such currencies, you need to set the [currency exponent](https://www.notion.so/Currency-f0c9b2bc2ddd45b7b960c11f609fa229) to 1.
