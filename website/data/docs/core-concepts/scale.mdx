Draft: the scale is what expresses the decimal relationship between the currency and its minor unit **for the object.**

The scale is one of the three pieces of domain data necessary to create a Dinero object. It's conceptually close to the [currency exponent](https://www.notion.so/Currency-f0c9b2bc2ddd45b7b960c11f609fa229) but serves the purpose of expressing precision as accurately as possible.

Most of the time, you don't need to specify the scale. It defaults to the currency exponent.

```js
import { dinero, toSnapshot } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

const d = dinero({ amount: 5000, currency: USD });

const { exponent } = USD; // `exponent` is 2
const { scale } = toSnapshot(d); // `scale` is 2 (picked up `USD.exponent`)
```

This looks redundant. Why do we need a scale when we have the currency exponent?

While you may think of money as its value in major or minor currency units—value that one can actually *pay*—it often needs a more precise representation. A good example is when you factor in tax rates, which are often fractional values. For example, let's say you have an item that costs €19.95 with a VAT rate of 5.5%: you end up with a final price of €21.04725. This gets rounded when it's time to pay, but **it's crucial to preserve the precision until the end of calculations**, especially if you're performing many of them.

The scale is essential to **accurately represent monetary values without losing precision.** It automatically adapts as needed to ensure you always retain accurate amounts.

Here's what the 5.5% VAT rate calculation looks like with Dinero.js:

```js
import { dinero, add, multiply, toSnapshot } from 'dinero.js';
import { EUR } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

const price = dinero({ amount: 1995, currency: EUR });
const tax = multiply(price, 55, { scale: 3 });
const total = add(price, tax);

toSnapshot(total);

// {
//   amount: 2104725,
//   currency: {
//     code: 'EUR',
//     base: 10,
//     exponent: 2,
//   },
//   scale: 5,
// }
```

The final Dinero object `total` has transparently adjusted to a `scale` of 5 to satisfy the need for extra precision. The amount of 2104725 can be interpreted as 21.04725 based on that scale instead of 21047.25 based on the currency exponent.

Note the usage of a scale when specifying the number by which to multiply. We want to calculate 5.5% of the price, or multiply it by 0.055 (5.5 / 100). We don't want to use floats, so instead, we're passing 55 with a scale of 3 (55 / 10^3 = 0.055).

## When to specify a scale manually

Most of the time, you don't need to specify the scale. You can let Dinero.js pick it up from the currency exponent. However, **there are times when you need to specify more precise amounts.**

For example, imagine you're in the hardware business. You're likely not selling screws one by one but by kits instead. Let's say you sell kits of 250 for $8.75; you still might need to represent the price of a single screw for admin purposes. In this case, a screw costs $0.035, which can't be accurately represented with two digits, so you can manually pass a larger `scale`.

```js
import { dinero, toSnapshot } from 'dinero.js';
import { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';

const price = dinero({ amount: 35, currency: USD, scale: 3 });

toSnapshot(total);

// {
//   amount: 35,
//   currency: {
//     code: 'USD',
//     base: 10,
//     exponent: 2,
//   },
//   scale: 3,
// }
```
