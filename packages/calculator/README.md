# @dinero.js/calculator

> Calculator implementation for Dinero.js.

**This package contains calculator implementations for the `number` type**. It also exposes a `Calculator` type to help you implement your own calculator. Everything you need to use Dinero.js is re-exported in the `dinero.js` package, you don't need to ever install `@dinero.js/calculator` or care about what's inside. It's only helpful if you're willing to contribute to Dinero.js, or if you're building a different Dinero.js implementation than the one in `dinero.js`.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

```sh
npm install @dinero.js/calculator

# or

yarn add @dinero.js/calculator
```
