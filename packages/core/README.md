# @dinero.js/core

> Shared code between Dinero.js packages.

**This package contains all common types and internal functions.** Everything you need to use Dinero.js is re-exported in the `dinero.js` package, you don't need to ever install `@dinero.js/core` or care about what's inside. It's only helpful if you're willing to contribute to Dinero.js, or if you're building a different Dinero.js implementation than the one in `dinero.js`.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

```sh
npm install @dinero.js/core

# or

yarn add @dinero.js/core
```
