> Common currency implementations for Dinero.js.

**This package contains currency implementations for [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) currencies, as well as a set of cryptocurrencies**, for convenience. It also exposes a `Currency` type to help you implement your own currencies.
