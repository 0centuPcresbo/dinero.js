In this article, we will show you how to download, install, and license FlowJo 10 software on your PC or Mac. We will also explain what a serial number is and how to use it to activate your license.
 
## Downloading and Installing FlowJo 10
 
To download FlowJo 10, you need to visit the official website of FlowJo and select your platform (PC or Mac) at the top of the page. You will see a link to download the latest version of FlowJo 10 for your operating system. For a PC, you need to download the .exe file and open it to install the program. For a Mac, you need to download the .zip file and double-click it to extract the program[^1^].
 
After downloading and extracting the program, you can launch it by double-clicking on the FlowJo icon on your desktop or in your applications folder. The first time you launch FlowJo 10, you will see a license information window that asks you to accept the license terms and choose a license option[^1^].
 
## Licensing FlowJo 10
 
To use FlowJo 10 with your own data, you need to have a valid license. There are three ways to obtain a license for FlowJo 10: using a portal account, using a serial number, or using a dongle[^1^].
 
- A portal account is an online account that allows you to access FlowJo 10 on any computer that has internet connection. To use a portal account, you need to register on the FlowJo portal website and purchase a subscription plan. Then, you can choose "Use your FlowJo Portal account" in the license information window and enter your username and password[^1^].
- A serial number is a 16-character code that is assigned to your computer's hardware address. To use a serial number, you need to purchase it from FlowJo or request a trial serial number for 30 days. Then, you can enter it in the license information window and click "Done" to activate your license[^1^].
- A dongle is a physical thumb drive that has a license key on it. To use a dongle, you need to plug it into your computer's USB port. FlowJo 10 will detect it automatically and allow you to click "Done" to authenticate your license[^1^].

If you do not have any of these license options, you can still use FlowJo 10 under a free demonstration license. However, this will only allow you to load and analyze specially enabled demonstration data files that are provided by FlowJo[^1^].
