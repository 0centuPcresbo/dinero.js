# Dionakra: A Classic Breakout Clone with a Sci-Fi Twist
 
If you are a fan of arcade games, you might remember Breakout, the 1976 game where you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bounce a ball to destroy bricks at the top. Breakout was a simple but addictive game that inspired many clones and variations over the years. One of them is Dionakra, a PC game released in 1998 by BWM Software and published by Midas Interactive Entertainment and Prism Leisure.
